## We support every protocol

- **gRPC** — Thanks to [**Connect**][connect], all APIs are accessible to tools from the entire gRPC ecosystem, interoperating seamlessly with Envoy, grpcurl, gRPC Gateway, gRPC-Web, and every other gRPC implementation.
- **REST** — Thanks to [**Vanguard**][vanguard], we seamlessly support REST.
- **GraphQL** — Lastly, thanks to [**Tailcall**][tailcall], they are all accessible via GraphQL.

[tailcall]: https://tailcall.run/

## Services

- Tailcall GraphQL Mesh on port 8000
- Workflow “Starter” on port 8081
- Domain microservices
  - Org µService on port 9090
  - User Profile µService on port 9091
  - License µService on port 9092

Each µService (“microservice”) supports basic CRUD operations.

## Mutations

The recommended way of creating resources in batch is by using a Temporal workflow. GraphQL provides the faintest illusion of ACID properties, since it allows clients to issue multiple writes in one HTTP request; however, per the [GraphQL spec][graphql-spec], the selection set is executed serially. It is for this reason we recommend creating data through a Temporal workflow.
